# Lamas AI

Welcome to Lamas AI â€” improving mammography workflows with medical-grade artificial intelligence. We build AI tools to analyze mammography exams and assist radiologists by:

- Detecting and flagging suspicious findings and lesions consistent with breast cancer
- Estimating breast density and other imaging biomarkers that affect cancer risk and screening sensitivity
- Extracting structured findings (locations, sizes, descriptors) from images
- Generating automatic, structured and evolutive radiology reports to save time and improve consistency

# Why Lamas AI?

- Faster reads: automated pre-analysis reduces the repetitive work radiologists face, letting them focus on interpretation and patient care.
- Better consistency: structured outputs and templates reduce variability between readers.
- Clinically relevant: models target findings and metrics used in everyday mammography reporting (BI-RADS descriptors, density categories, lesion characterization).
- Evolutive reports: reports can be updated over time as new studies arrive, supporting longitudinal care.

# Getting started

1. Explore the models and datasets we provide or integrate your own mammography DICOMs.
2. Run the AI pre-analysis to receive detected findings, density estimates, and a draft structured report.
3. Review, edit, and finalize the report within your PACS or reporting system.

# Privacy & regulatory notes

Lamas AI is designed to work with de-identified DICOM data and follow applicable healthcare privacy standards. When deploying in clinical settings, ensure compliance with local regulations and device approval requirements.
